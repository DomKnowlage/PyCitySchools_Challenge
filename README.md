# Overview
We we're comissioned by the school board to undertake an audit of Thomas High School in reagard to thier testing scores. The board noticed some discripencies regarding the freshman classes test scores appearing to be altered.

# Findings
* We noticed some missing values from the Thomas High School in the Freshman test scores were missing
* Removing these values skews the data making it look like the school is preforming better than it actually is
* This gives more funding allocated to Thomas High School
